The Earth and Colonies Defence Service (ECDS) keeps the colonies and space lanes safe. On Earth, the Android Protectorate League, led by the enigmatic android leader Traviod Selius, campaign for android rights legislation. However, they are strongly opposed by the Anti-Android Faction (AAF). Following the approval of the Human and Android Cohabitation Act, ECDS Chief of Operations Nakaar Bacvor and co-conspirators form the military wing of the AAF. The AAF attack the Moon and Mars colonies, but are repulsed by ECDS forces. On Earth, with the AAF seemingly defeated, humans and androids unite to create the city of Utopia. Threats from a reformed, more powerful AAF emerges and the crew of the ECDS flagship Harmonia must formulate a defence. The mysterious Evolved Androids appear on Earth with a sytoid child called Eirini, who has strange powers. Utopian Enforcement officer Rul Calibra becomes her unlikely guardian and protector.Humankind's destiny hangs in the balance in the first series installment ANDROID: Earth - Book One of the ANDROID Saga. Paul J. Ward was born in 1969 in Lincolnshire, England, on the day of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing. He has been fascinated by space exploration and technological developments his whole life.

      "description": "Developing applications for Android and other mobile devices using web technologies is now well within reach. When the capabilities of HTML5 are combined with CSS3 and JavaScript, web application developers have an opportunity to develop compelling mobile applications using familiar tools. Not only is it possible to build mobile web apps that feel as good as native apps, but to also write an application once and have it run a variety of different devices. While the HTML5 specification is still evolving, there is a lot that can be used right now to build mobile web apps. Mobile web apps are now starting to provide many of the features that were once only available to native-language-based apps in Java, Objective-C, etc. Pro Android Web Apps teaches developers already familiar with web application development, how to code and structure a web app for use on the Android mobile platform. Understand both the why and how of mobile web app development, focusing on the Android platform. Learn how to structure mobile web apps through a number of practical, real-world application examples. Discover what cloud platforms such as Google AppEngine have to offer Android web apps, for both hosting web apps and providing device to cloud data synchronization solutions. Get a real picture of the status of HTML5 on Android and other mobile devices, including some things to watch out for when building your own applications. Understand the capabilities of the web application stack, and how to complement those with native bridging frameworks such as PhoneGap to access native features of the device. Gain an understanding of the different UI frameworks that are available for building mobile web apps. Learn how to include mapping and leverage location-based services in mobile web apps to create engaging mobile experiences. Enable social integration with your Android web app and gain access to millions of potential users. After reading this book, you will not only have a greater understanding of the world of web apps on Android, but also how to leverage additional tools and frameworks to increase the reach of your mobile web apps. Additionally, through the practical samples in the book you will have been given solid exposure of where both the opportunities and challenges lie when building mobile apps the web way. What you’ll learn What Android web apps can do, and when to use web development rather than native development to create an application. How to use existing JavaScript and CSS frameworks to create rich mobile user interfaces. When to use HTML5 and when to use a native bridging framework to access native Android functionality. Connext with cloud services and APIs to build engaging location based services and games. Enable social integration with your Android web app and gain access to millions of potential users. Who this book is for This book is targeted at web developers looking to transfer their skills over to mobile application development. Readers will understand that Android is continuing to gain momentum in the marketplace and will want to build an application specifically for that platform. They will have a strong desire to use web technologies rather than the native tools to build applications, either due to personal taste or to gain cross-platform mobile portability for the majority of their application code.

      "description": "Battle-Tested Best Practices for Securing Android Apps throughout the Development Lifecycle Android’s immense popularity has made it today’s #1 target for attack: high-profile victims include eHarmony, Facebook, and Delta Airlines, just to name a few. Today, every Android app needs to resist aggressive attacks and protect data, and in Bulletproof Android™, Godfrey Nolan shows you how. Unlike “black hat/gray hat” books, which focus on breaking code, this guide brings together complete best practices for hardening code throughout the entire development lifecycle. Using detailed examples from hundreds of apps he has personally audited, Nolan identifies common “anti-patterns” that expose apps to attack, and then demonstrates more secure solutions. Nolan covers authentication, networking, databases, server attacks, libraries, hardware, and more. He illuminates each technique with code examples, offering expert advice on implementation and trade-offs. Each topic is supported with a complete sample app, which demonstrates real security problems and solutions. Learn how to Apply core practices for securing the platform Protect code, algorithms, and business rules from reverse engineering Eliminate hardcoding of keys, APIs, and other static data Eradicate extraneous data from production APKs Overcome the unique challenges of mobile authentication and login Transmit information securely using SSL Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks Safely store data in SQLite databases Prevent attacks against web servers and services Avoid side-channel data leakage through third-party libraries Secure APKs running on diverse devices and Android versions Achieve HIPAA or FIPS compliance Harden devices with encryption, SELinux, Knox, and MDM Preview emerging attacks and countermeasures This guide is a perfect complement to Nolan’s Android™ Security Essentials LiveLessons (video training; ISBN-13: 978-0-13-382904-4) and reflects new risks that have been identified since the LiveLessons were released.",
